# Stock Tracker

I made this program for my highschool classes. The task was to keep track of stocks manually for 3 months. I didn't want to do that so I wrote a script to do it for me.

I used [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) to print to a excel spreadsheet and [yahoofinancials](https://pypi.org/project/yahoofinancials/) to read the stock market.
